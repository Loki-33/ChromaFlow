# NF-AUDIO SYNTHESIZER
A normalizing flow model is trained to model the distribution of high-quality artwork images, enabling exact likelihood estimation and invertible image synthesis. Generated images are then analyzed using perceptually motivated visual features—including color distributions, spatial symmetry, edge density, and texture complexity—which are mapped to audio synthesis parameters such as pitch, harmonic content, envelope shape, and noise
